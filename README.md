# SeisElastic2D_1.1

SeisElastic2D is an open-source package for multiparameter FWI in isotropic-, anisotropic- and visco-elastic media built upon several exiting packages including SPECFEM2D, seisDD, etc. Note that the SPECFEM2D package in SeisElastic2D has been updated to calculate the sensitivity kernels in isotropic-, VTI-, TTI- and visco-elastic media with various model parameterizations.

This package can be installed on large parallel computing cluster and local workstation with multiple processors. It provides different misfit functions, model parameterizations, advanced optimization methods, flexible inversion strategies and workflows, etc.  These features make it promising to overcome the difficulties in multiparameter elastic FWI and bridge the gap between adademic studies and industrial application. Using SeisElastic2D, we have applied isotropic-, VTI- and visco-elastic FWI to practical seismic data for hydrocarbon reservoir characterization.

Compared to SeisElastic2D version 1.0 (https://github.com/crewesleo/SeisElastic2D), this new version has the following updates:

(1) The package structure has been re-organized for easy-using;

(2) Scripts are provided for setting the paths, installing the packages, runing the forward modelling and FWI experiment on a local workstation;

(3) Three different approaches are provided for calculating the Q sensitivity kernels in visco-elastic FWI;

(4) New parameters are added for forward modelling and FWI with complex topographic variations;

(5) Scripts for 3D forward modelling and FWI experiments with GPU are added (the 3D modeling and FWI examples will be provided in SeisElastic3D.)

Please follow the steps below for installing and running the examples on a local workstation with at least 8 processors available:

(1) Install the prerequisite packages, as introduced in section 2.2.1 of the manual;
    
    a. IntelÂ® Parallel Studio XE for Linux is available at
       https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/qualify-for-free-software.html
    b. openmpi_4.3.0 is available at https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v4.0/

(2) Set the paths for SeisElastic2D by source 0_setup.sh, as introduced in section 2.2.2 of the manual. 
    Before running 0_setup.sh, please change the corresponding paths in 0_setup.sh for openmpi and ifort, as shown in the following:
    
    ## set the path for intel compiler. The users need to adjust the following paths according to your own computer
    alias ifort='/home/wenyongp/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2020.1.217/linux/bin/intel64/ifort'
    source /home/wenyongp/intel/bin/ifortvars.sh ia32
    source /home/wenyongp/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
    ## set the path for Openmpi
    export PATH=/home/wenyongp/Programs/Openmpi-4.0.3/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/wenyongp/Programs/Openmpi-4.0.3/lib
    ## set the path for Seismic Unix
    export CWPROOT=/home/wenyongp/Programs/SU
    export PATH=$PATH:/home/wenyongp/Programs/SU/bin

(3) Install scotch, SPECFEM2D and SeisElastic2D by bash 1_compile.sh, as introduced in sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the manual. Before running 1_compile.sh, please set the paths of icc and mpicc in ./specfem2d/src/meshfem2D/scotch_6.0.4/src/Makefile.inc for installing scotch, as shown in the following:

    CCS		= /home/wenyongp/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2020.1.217/linux/bin/intel64/icc
    CCP		= /home/wenyongp/Programs/Openmpi-4.0.3/bin/mpicc
    CCD		= /home/wenyongp/Programs/Openmpi-4.0.3/bin/mpicc

(4) Do forward modeling by bash 2_forward_modeling_example.sh, as introduced in section 3 of the manual.

(5) Do inversion experiment by bash 3_inversion_example.sh, as introduce in sections 2.2.4 and 4 of the manual;

(6) Plot the results by bash 4_plot_results.sh.
